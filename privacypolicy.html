            </div>
            <p class="font-theme-para">
                On 2nd September, 2020, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY),
                Government of India invoking its power under section 69A of the Information Technology Act
                read with the relevant provisions of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public)
                Rules 2009 and in view of the emergent nature of threats, blocked 118 mobile apps. As per the notification issued by MEITY,
                these apps were engaged in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of State and public order.
                Further, MEITY had received many complaints from various sources including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS
                platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India.
                The compilation of this data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India,
                which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern
                which required emergency measures. This move by MEITY was to safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users.
                This decision is a targeted move to ensure safety, security and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace.
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">This decision by MEITY has yet again opened up the discussion on the urgent need to have strong Data Protection Laws in India.</p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                As per a report published by Statista, presently there are nearly 700 million internet users in India.
                This figure is projected to grow to over 974 million users by 2025. In fact, India was ranked as the second largest online market worldwide in 2019, coming second only to China.

            <div class="heading-text p-l-10">
                <span class="text-uppercase  font-heading-medium">Right to privacy is a fundamental right in India</span>

            </div>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                Right to privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which lays down our fundamental rights.
                This was affirmed by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India in its historic judgment dated 24th August 2017
                wherein they declared ‘the right to privacy’ as an integral part of Part III of the Constitution of Constitution of India.
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                One would wonder why this question of whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right or not, was brought before a bench with nine-judges.
                In 2017, a bench of five judges in the Supreme Court which was hearing the case on Aadhaar Card and the right to privacy,
                said that they wanted a nine-judge bench to first decide if privacy is a fundamental right, before deciding on the main Aadhaar case.
                The Attorney General in the Aadhaar case had then argued that although several Supreme Court judgments had recognized the right to privacy, however,
                they had refused to accept that the right to privacy was a fundamental right in the Kharak Singh judgment (passed by a six- judge bench in 1960)
                and M P Sharma judgement (delivered by an eight-judge Constitution bench in 1954). It was therefore necessary to constitute a nine-judge bench to
                decide whether or not right to privacy is a fundamental right .
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">This broad interpretation by the Supreme Court led to a stream of initiatives by the government towards Personal Data Protection laws.</p>



            <div class="heading-text p-l-10">
                <span class="text-uppercase  font-heading-medium">Current laws prevalent in India</span>

            </div>


            <p class="font-theme-para">
                India does not have a stand-alone personal data protection law to protect personal data and information shared or received in a verbal or written or electronic form.
                Though, protections are available, they are contained in a mix of statutes, rules and guidelines.
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                The most prominent provisions are contained in the Information Technology Act, 2000 (as amended by the Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008)
                read with the Information Technology [Reasonable Security Practices And Procedures And Sensitive Personal Data Or Information] Rules, 2011 (SPDI Rules).
                It is the primary law in India dealing with cybercrime and electronic commerce. SPDI Rules, as the name suggests,
                only cover data and information which is exchanged in an electronic form and not those received through non-electronic communication form.
            </p>


            <p class="font-theme-para">
                When this IT Act, 2000 came into force on October 17, 2000, all the laws and procedures in reference to the given Act lacked
                the protection and provisions required to protect one’s sensitive personal information provided electronically. This eventually led to the introduction
                of the Information Technology Bill, 2006 in the Indian Parliament which then led to the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 whose provisions came
                into force on October 27, 2009. It inserted Section 43A in the Information Technology Act, according to which, if:
            </p>
            <p class="font-theme-para">
                a corporate body possesses or deals with any sensitive personal data or information, and is negligent in maintaining reasonable security to protect such data or information,
                which thereby causes wrongful loss or wrongful gain to any person, then such body corporate shall be liable to pay damages to the person(s) so affected.
            </p>
            <p class="font-theme-para">Also Section 72A, according to which:</p>
            <p class="font-theme-para">
                the punishment for disclosure of information in breach of lawful contract and any person may be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or with a fine not exceeding up to five lakh rupees,
                or with both, in case disclosure of the information is made in breach of lawful contract.
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">Penalty for the same is mentioned in Section 72 of the IT Act. The Section provides that:</p>
            <p class="font-theme-para">
                any person who, in pursuance of any of the powers conferred under the IT Act Rules or Regulations made thereunder,
                has secured access to any electronic record, book, register, correspondence, information, document or other material without the consent of the person concerned,
                discloses such electronic record, book, register, correspondence, information, document or other material to any other person, shall be punishable with imprisonment
                for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to Rs 1,00,000, (approx. US$ 3,000) or with both.
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                Section 75 mandates that provisions of this Act shall also apply to an offence/contravention committed outside
                India by any person if the conduct constituting an offence involves a computer/computer network located in India.
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                However, the scope and coverage of the IT Act and Rules are limited. Majority of the provisions only apply
                to ‘sensitive personal data and information’ collected through ‘computer resource’. The provisions are restricted to corporate entities
                undertaking the automated processing of data and consumers are only able to take enforcement action in relation to a small subset of the provisions.
                There is no provision on data localisation which was the major concern and reason for the ban of the Chinese apps in India.
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">In order to address these limitations, India needed a comprehensive data privacy law.</p>

            <div class="heading-text p-l-10">
                <span class="text-uppercase  font-heading-medium">The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019</span>

            </div>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                After the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in the Justice KS Puttaswamy case, which held that privacy is a constitutional right,
                the MEITY formed a 10 member committee lead by retired Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna for making recommendations for a draft Bill
                on protection of personal data. After working on it for a year, the committee submitted its report titled “A Free and Fair Digital Economy:
                Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians ” along with the draft bill on personal data protection. The revised Personal Data Protection Bill,
                2019 (Bill), was introduced by Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, in the Lok Sabha on December 11, 2019.
                Currently, the Bill is being examined by a 30-member team of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) and is asked to present its report in the winter
                session of the Parliament in December 2020.
            </p>

            <div class="heading-text p-l-10">
                <span class="text-uppercase  font-heading-medium">The Salient features of the Bill</span>

            </div>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                Post the ban of Chinese apps, an individual would naturally be concerned whether their personal data floating around, was secure.
                An individual would want to know what safeguards, norms are imposed under the Bill on collecting and processing of data,
                as well as the cross-border transfer of such data:
            </p>


            <p class="font-theme-para">
                <b>1. Application of the Act to processing of personal data</b>– The Bill governs the processing of personal data where such data has been collected, disclosed,
                shared or otherwise processed within the territory of India by;
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                i. Government, any Indian company, any citizen of India or any person or body of persons incorporated or created under Indian law;

                ii. Data fiduciaries or data processors not present within the territory of India, if such processing is— (a) in connection with any business carried on in India,
                or any systematic activity of offering goods or services to data principals within the territory of India; or (b) in connection with any activity which involves profiling
                of data principals within the territory of India.
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                iii. However, it will not apply to anonymised data. Anonymisation in relation to personal data, means such irreversible process of transforming or converting personal data
                to a form in which a data principal cannot be identified,which meets the standards of irreversibility specified by the Authority; Anonymised data means
                data which has undergone the process of anonymisation;

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                <b>2. Kinds of personal data</b>– The Bill has categorised data under three broad heads– Personal Data, Sensitive Personal Data, and Critical Personal Data.
            </p>



            <p class="font-theme-para">
                i. Personal data includes data which pertains to characteristics, traits or attributes of identity, which can be used to identify an individual, collected online or offline.

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                ii. Sensitive Personal data includes financial data, biometric data, caste, religious or political beliefs, or any other category of data specified by the government, in consultation with the Authority and the concerned sectoral regulator.
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                iii. Critical Personal Data means such personal data as may be notified by the Central Government to be the critical personal data.

                the data principal or which is incidental to or connected with such purpose, and which the data principal would reasonably expect that

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                The Bill, as stated in its preamble, provides for protection of the privacy of individuals relating to their personal data, specifies the flow and usage of personal data, 
                creates a relationship of trust between persons and entities processing the personal data, protecting the rights of individuals whose personal data are processed in order 
                to create a framework for organisational and technical measures in processing of data, laying down norms for social media intermediary, cross-border transfer, accountability
                of entities processing such personal data. The Bill also seeks to provide remedies for unauthorised and harmful processing, and to establish a Data Protection Authority of India
                for the said purposes and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
            </p>

            <p class="font-theme-para">
                The underlying principles of the Bill are broadly similar to those in the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”) .
            </p>
            <p class="font-theme-para">
                In the present COVID-19 situation, people are compelled to maintain social distancing and necessitating them to stay home and work from home. 
                This situation has triggered a huge dependence on digital platform. Under these circumstances, India urgently needs to fast track the clearance 
                of the new Personal Data Protection Bill. When and how the said Bill gets enacted, and the way in which it is enforced is yet to be seen and the 
                same shall determine the fate of data of millions of Indians.
